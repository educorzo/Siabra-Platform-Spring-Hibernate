Siabra-Platform-Spring-Hibernate
ADAPTIVE INFORMATION SYSTEM BASED on AUGEMENTED REALITY
================================

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/TtFbBT3.png" /> This is a new version of SIABRA developed with Java Spring and Hibernate.

The original version of SIABRA is developed with Python and Django. I love to work with Java, so I decided to developed SIABRA with Spring MVC and Hibernate. On these days I will develop and pull the code in order to achieve the original project ( http://siabra.pythonanywhere.com ). At the end of this project I will open a blog with the purpose of  telling the main differences between Django and Spring (in a subjective view).

SIABRA has an awesome documentation (in Spanish). Than
