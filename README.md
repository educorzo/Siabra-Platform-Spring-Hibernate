ADAPTIVE INFORMATION SYSTEM BASED on AUGEMENTED REALITY 
================================

This is a new version of SIABRA developed with Java Spring and Hibernate.

The original version of SIABRA is developed with Python and Django. I love to work with Java, so I decided to developed SIABRA with Spring MVC and Hibernate. On these days I'm going to develop and pull the code in order to "clone" the original project ( http://siabra.pythonanywhere.com ). At the end of this project I will open a blog with the purpose of resuming the main differences between Django and Spring (in a subjective view).

SIABRA has an awesome documentation (in Spanish). If you want to check it with his UML, IFML, development process etc... , contact me by email eduardocorzo@outlook.com
